# 分支预测Branch Prediction
计算机中，遇到分支结构的程序指令时，普通处理方式是停止当前执行的指令，等待相关的指令执行完成后才执行分支。为了节省时间就采用分支预测技术。即不等到相关指令执行完成才执行分支，而是**预测分支的进行方向**，提前执行某个分支。等到相关指令执行完成后判断预测是否正确。  
宏观上，在执行if这种语句时，底层就会使用到分支预测。  
这种技术可能会拖慢性能。因为当预测失败时就会浪费资源。宏观上的一个表现就是在对未排序的数组进行处理时慢过排序后的数组

You are a processor and you see a branch. You have no idea which way it will go. What do you do? You halt execution and wait until the previous instructions are complete. Then you continue down the correct path.  
Modern processors are complicated and have long pipelines. This means they take forever to "warm up" and "slow down".  
Is there a better way? You guess which direction the branch will go!  
**If you guessed right**, you continue executing.  
**If you guessed wrong**, you need to flush the pipeline and roll back to the branch. Then you can restart down the other path.  
If you guess right every time, the execution will never have to stop.  
If you guess wrong too often, you spend a lot of time stalling, rolling back, and restarting.
