# 文件
C/C++都可以用一个函数将输入输出重定向至文件:freopen();该函数有三个参数，第一个是文件名称，如果该名称文件在当前目录不存在的话则会创建一个新的。第二个参数是如何对文件进行访问的一个符号。第三个是需要被重定向的流。常规做法如下
```cpp
freopen("general.in","r",stdin);
freopen("general.out","w",stdout);
```

| ---- | ---- |
|"r"|**read**: Open a file for input operation. The file must exist.|
|"w"|**write**: Create an empty file for output operations. If a file with the same name already exists, its contents are discarded and the file is treated as a new empty file.|
|"a"|**append**: Open file for output at the end of a file. Output operations always write data at the end of the file, expanding it. Repositioning operations (fseek, fsetpos, rewind) are ignored. The file is created if it does not exist.|
| "r+"|**read/update**: Open a file for update (both for input and output). The file must exist.| 

*What does the "update" mean? You insert from the begining of the file. For example, if the original content of the file is "Didyouchange?", and you "r+" and cout<<"lhx". After the operation, the file will be "lhxyouchange?".*

feof(FILE)  该函数判断对应文件指针中的位置标识是否已经到了EOF即文件的结尾处。如果已经到函数的结尾则返回1否则返回0
fprintf(FILE,"",)  
fscanf(FILE,"",)
