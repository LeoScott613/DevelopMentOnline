# How to IMPROVE algorithm
The new discovery today is I should improve my imagination.   
Yet imagination has been making me suffering, without the imagination, I can't understand the expression of certain algorithm. For instance, the railway station problem. If I can't imagine what's happening when a stack is pushed or poped, I won't understand how that very solution works.   
**But make sure not to imagine only for fun! I should train it till I can make what I really want to make in my mind**
